# MyLittleProject
Data Exploration, binary calssification and multi class classification of epileptic seizure dataset

This project attempts to predict the class of seizure against 4 other classes using 178 explanatory variables.

This is done using a Random Forest classifier from sklearn. The dimensionality is reduced using PCA. 
The binary classification achieves a recall of around 98%. The multilabel classification reaches a score of 75%.
